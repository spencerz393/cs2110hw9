/**
* @brief Draw the (unfilled) circle provided, onto the screen provided.

* @details To draw a circle, you will need to use an algorithm named Bresenham's
*          Circle Drawing algorithm, which is explained below in pseudocode:
*
*          bresenhamCircle(int mx, int my, int radius) {
*              int x = 0;
*              int y = radius;
*              int d = 1 â€“ radius;
*
*              while (x <= y) {
*                  plot(mx + x, my + y);
*                  plot(mx + x, my - y);
*
*                  plot(mx - x, my + y);
*                  plot(mx - x, my - y);
*
*                  plot(mx + y, my + x);
*                  plot(mx + y, my - x);
*
*                  plot(mx - y, my + x);
*                  plot(mx - y, my - x);
*
*                  if (d < 0) {
*                      d = d + 2 * x + 3;
*                      x += 1;
*                  } else {
*                      d = d + 2 * (x-y) + 5;
*                      x += 1;
*                      y -= 1;
*                  }
*              }
*          }
*
*          Important! Your code CANNOT import any additional library, so you
*          can implement the absolute values using ternaries and NOT stdlib!
*
*          Important! The pseudocode talks about a "signum" function. Signum is
*          Latin for sign, and the function is simply used to get the sign of an
*          integer. Therefore signum(x) is equal to:
*               -1 if x < 0,
*               0 if x = 0,
*               1 if x > 0.
*
*          You therefore also need to use a ternary for this since such a func.
*          is not avaiable for you to use without using the standard libraries.

/**
* @brief Draw the image provided, onto the screen provided, using the provided
*        crop window and filter.
* @param screen The Screen to draw onto.
* @param image The Image to draw.
* @param cropWindow The CropWindow to crop the image with.
* @param colorFilter The color filter function that you will pass each pixel of
*                    the image through, before drawing it.
* @details To draw the image, you will repeat the procedure you used for
*          drawFilledRectangle, but instead of drawing the same color repeatedly
*          you will draw the filtered version of the corresponding pixel from
*          the image provided.
*
*          However, to make this function more flexible, we want to give it the
*          ability to draw just a section of the
*          source image, which will be identified by the cropWindow. The
*          cropWindow contains the position (x, y) of the image where you should
*          start getting pixels from (i.e. the cropWindow top_left pixel will be
*          the first pixel to draw, and it will be drawn at the top_left pixel
*          of the screen provided in the image parameter). You will also get the
*          width and height of the cropWindow and only draw so many pixels from
*          the image, starting at the crop window's top_left point.
*
*          NOTE: THE DRAWN PIXELS SHOULD STILL APPEAR ON THE SCREEN AT THE IMAGE
*          STRUCT'S TOP_LEFT COORDINATES ONWARDS! THE CROP WINDOW ONLY CHANGES
*          WHAT PIXELS YOU RETRIEVE FROM THE IMAGE, BUT THESE DIFFERENT PIXELS
*          SHOULD NOW APPEAR AT THE ORIGIN OF THE IMAGE ON THE SCREEN. LOOK AT
*          THE TESTS IF YOU AREN'T SURE WHAT THIS MEANS.
*
*          A small hint: write the code as though you would draw the entire
*          image. The cropWindow only changes the starting and ending points of
*          your coordinate iteration loops. Instead of starting at the top_left
*          of the image and drawing a box the size of the image, change your
*          loops such that you start at the top_left of the crop window and draw
*          a box the size of the cropWindow.
*
*          Things to consider:
*              * Each pixel obtained from the image needs to be passed through
*                the filter function before being drawn.
*              * If no crop window is provided (if cropWindow == NULL) then you
*                can assume that the entire image will be drawn, and thus create
*                a CropWindow of the full image size, then proceeding normally.
*              * You need to make sure that if the crop window isn't larger than
*                the image or exceeding its bounds in any way, you perform the
*                crop within the bounds of the image, disregarding areas of the
*                crop window outside the image bounds.
